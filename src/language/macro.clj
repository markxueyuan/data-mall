(let [x 2]
  `(let [y ~x]
     y))

;is basically the same as

(let [x 2]
  (list 'let (vector 'y x) 'y))

;the following two's difference helps understand ~@

(let [x '(1 2 3)]
  `(println ~(map (fn [y] (* y 2)) x) 'done))

(let [x '(1 2 3)]
  `(println ~@(map (fn [y] (* y 2)) x) 'done))

;In this expression, the elements from x are run through map, which doubles their values.
;The output of map is inserted into the list that starts with println and ends with 'done.
;Notice that 'done in the output is still quoted.
;It was read in as data—'done—and output as the same data.

(let [x 42]
  `(let [x 13]
     [x x]))

(let [x 42]
  `(let [x# 13]

;let's practice a quick macro

(let [x (+ 42 13)]

;realize a foreach macro,this basically equals to the function of doseq (but not clojure's for)

(defmacro foreach

;we'd like macro returns list to represent futher calls of functions, forms or macros.

(defmacro hello
  [name]
  (list 'println name))

(macroexpand-1 '(hello "Brian"))

;whereas using list is a natural way, It would be out of control when codes become complicated

;as the following one
(defmacro while
  [test & body]
  (list 'loop []
        (concat (list 'when test) body '((recur)))))

(def a (atom 10))

(while (> @a 3) (do (println @a) (swap! a dec)))

;we use this syntax sugar

(defmacro while
  [test & body]
  `(loop []
     (when ~test
       ~@body
       (recur))))

;syntax quote
(def foo 123)

(list `map `println [foo]);is the same as

`(map println [~foo]);and

`(map println ~[foo])

(list `println (list `keyword (list `str foo)));is the same as

`(println (keyword (str ~foo)))

(let [defs `((def x 123)
             (def y 456))]
  (concat (list `do) defs))

(let [defs '((def x 123)
             (def y 456))]

;notice that splice unquote implicitly include a concatenate operation
;the list defs are spliced into the surrounding syntax-quoted list

;a very common idiom

(defmacro foo

  `(do-something
    ~@body))

(macroexpand-1
 `(foo
   (doseq [x [1 2 3]]
     (* x 2))
   :hehe))

;quote again, so that the returned forms by macro won't be evaluated

;macroexpand is a function, any value of it would be evaluated

;quote, unquote, unquote-splicing are all functions.

;we can see what these 'functions' actually do by quoting them to stop the return forms evaluated

;you cannot let a qualified x

(defmacro incorrect-let

;we would take some clever roundabout ways to solve this problem

(defmacro unhygiene-let
  [& body]
  `(let [~'x 3]
     ~@body))

;however, this has a macro hygiene problem

(let [x 4]
  (unhygiene-let (println ":x" x)))

;here is the problem, the code calls macro does not know the macro returns form bingding x to another value


(macroexpand-1 '(unhygiene-let (println ":x" x)))


(defmacro hello
  [a]
  `(let [~'x 3]
     (concat [x] [~a])))

(unhygiene-let (println "x:" x))

(eval `(let [~'x 3] ~'(println "x:" x)))

(defmacro abc

    `(let [~sym :macro-value]
       ~@body
       ~sym)))

(let [x :important]
  (hygienic (println "x:" x)))

;this makes macro safe, we can use auto-gensym to make it more simple

(defmacro hygeienic
  [& body]
  `(let [x# :macro-value]
     ~@body
     x#))

(let [x :important]

;auto-gensym under same syntax quote expand to same actual symbol

(defmacro auto-gensyms

     (+ x# ~@numbers)))

(auto-gensyms 1 2 3 4)

(macroexpand-1 `(auto-gensyms 1 2 3 4))

;however, to unify gensyms in multiple syntax quote, we go back to use (gensym)

(defmacro our-doto

    `(let [~obj ~expr]
     ~@(map (fn [[f & args]]

;double evaluation problem

(defmacro spy
